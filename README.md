# SlamAzon

Command line version of a Amazon-like storefront, created using Node.js and MySQL.

## Getting Started

There is a file named 'SlamAzonSchema.sql' that will create the database required to run the application, and includes some seed data for manipulation. In order to run the actual application after installing the dependencies, run the command 'node slamazonCustomer.js' in your terminal.
